# Game of Thrones Challenge

## Introduction

This repository is for Game of Thrones Challenge

## Data Source:

http://anapioficeandfire.com/api/

## Data Set Information:

This challenge will involve querying an API and extracting information from it. The API in question provides information on Game of Thrones, allowing one to access information on the houses, characters and books.

* API URL: http://anapioficeandfire.com/api/{SECTION}/{INDEX}

Where SECTION can be either ‘books’, ‘characters’, or ‘houses’ and INDEX is an integer to a certain entry in a section.

For example, to access the character Peter Baelish, the full request would be http://anapioficeandfire.com/api/characters/823, where 823 is the index corresponding to that character. 

It's recommended to read the full documentation, which can be found here: https://anapioficeandfire.com/Documentation
